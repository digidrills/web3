### POLYGON Blockchain

#### Drawbacks of ethereum:

<li>Low throughput : Can only process 15-25 transactions per second.
<li>Not user friendly : The transaction requests corresponding to users who are willing to pay more transaction fees will be preferred.</li>

#### Polygon blockchain:
<li>Polygon is a “layer two” or “sidechain” scaling solution that consists of a series of blockchains.</li>
<li>It provides faster transactions and lower costs for users as it uses POS consensus.</li>
<li>It acts as a speedy parallel blockchain running alongside the main Ethereum blockchain.</li>
<li>Its currency is MATIC and is an ERC-20 token. </li>
<li>It aims to improve upon Ethereum as a blockchain development network.</li>

#### Ethereum vs Polygon
        
| Parameter         | Ethereum | Polygon     |
| :---              |    :----:   |          :---: |
| Transactions         | 15-25 transactions per second      | 65000 transactions per second   |
| Gas fees   | Transactions are handled individually. Thus, high gas fees.| Transactions are handled in bulk. Thus, low gas fees.|
| Consensus           | Proof of work (POW)       | Proof of Stake (POS)      |

#### Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake
        
| Parameter         | Proof of Work | Proof of Stake     |
| :---              |    :----:   |          :---: |
| Selection of Miner        | The probability of mining a block is determined by how much computational work is done by the miner.      | The probability of validating a new block is determined by how large of a stake a miner holds.  |
| Competition between miners  | The probability of validating a new block is determined by how large of a stake a miner holds.| There is no competition as block creator is chosen by an algorithm based on user stake.|
|Malicious attacks       | Hackers would need to have 51% of computation power to add malicious blocks.    | Hackers would need to own 51% of all cryptocurrency on the network, which is practically impossible.      |
|Reward| A reward is given to the first miner who solves the cryptographic puzzle of each block.|The validators do not receive a block reward instead they collect network fee as their reward.|
|Investment  |Initial investment to buy hardware.| Initial investment to buy stake and build reputation.|
|Efficiency|    They are less energy and cost efficient |      They are highly cost and energy efficient |
