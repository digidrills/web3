<li>After the token was created we tried to transfer the tokens across different metamask wallets (Peer to Peer Transfers) and also check the balance in the wallet and successful transaction was done with the required gas fee per transfer.
<li>P2P transfer example:

Can view transactions of our smart contract in the above link.
<li>Later when we explored more about bunzz it doesn’t have an option to define a customized smart contract. Hence stopped. <br><br>
