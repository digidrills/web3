### Working of LEGITDOC

<li> Documents are generated as PDFs by Issuers</li>
<li> Unique fingerprint for each PDF is computed by LegitDoc software</li>
<li> All PDF fingerprints are condensed into a single fingerprint</li>
<li> The single fingerprint is uploaded on public Blockchain against Issuerâ€™s public key</li>
<li> A unique blockchain- based Proof File (hash code) is generated for each PDF</li>
<li> Original PDF document + Corresponding Proof Data = LegitDoc PDF</li>
<li> LegitDoc PDF files are issued to respective document owners; these files can now be shared with Verifiers</li>
<li> Verifiers upload LegitDoc PDF files on the LegitDoc Verification Portal</li>
<li> Verification Portal compares LegitDoc PDF file data with the data on the blockchain</li>
<li> Verifiers are notified of the authenticity of the document</li>
