| Index  | Term | Meaning  |

| 1 | Blockchain | A  digital ledger that stores information in blocks that are linked to one another. |
| 2 | Block | A data structure that  permanently stores records -once written, cannot be altered or removed(Linkage of blocks). |
| 3 | Node | Nodes are network stakeholders and their devices that are authorized to keep track of the distributed ledger and serve as communication hubs for various network tasks |
| 4 | Coin | Act as a form of money, operates on its own blockchain and can be mined.<br> Example: Bitcoin |
| 5 | Token | Similar to a coin except that it doesnâ€™t operate on its own blockchain and uses other blockchains.<br>Tokens can be exchanged freely among peers.<br>Example: Tether USD(USDT) ,Binance USD(BUSD)|
| 6 | Non fungible tokens(NFT) | Tokens created to represent digital assets such as images- unique to each other.<br>Each token consists of a Metadata(usually a link) to the image. This metadata is stored in the data section.<br>This Metadata is stored on the blockchain and can be traded P2P.|
| 7 | Gas fees | Fee required to perform a transaction or execute a contract.Paid via native coin of the blockchain where the transaction is executed.<br>Fees are collected regardless of successful or failed transactions.<br>Eg: To interact with a smart contract deployed on Ethereum blockchain, we will have to pay gas fees in Ethereum.|
| 8 | Smart Contracts | Self-executing contracts.Contents of the buyer-seller agreement are inscribed directly into lines of code.|
| 9 | Web3 wallet | Capable of storing digital assets such as coins,tokens and NFTs .Enables transfer between peers via the two wallets and interaction with dApps.|
| 10 | dApps | Digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers instead of a single computer.|
| 11 | Mining| Process where coins are given as a reward for authenticating and completing blocks of verified transactions on the blockchain.|
| 12 | TPS | Transactions per second|


### Permissionless vs Permissioned Blockchain

| Parameter | Permissioned | Permissionless  |
| :---              |    :----:   |          :---: |
| Type | Blockchain networks that require access to be part of the network |Networks that are public and where anyone can be a part of the network and access it.  |
| Speed | Can be scaled to 20000 TPS.<br>Avg transactions ~ 3000 TPS| Depends on the blockchain network chosen.<br>For Eg Solana and polygon can be scaled to 65000 TPS <br>Avg transactions currently happening ~ 1800 TPS|
| Security | Comparatively Less Secure | More Secure due to the decentralized nature. |
| Ownership | Managed by a group of nodes pre-defined by the network admin. <br>New members(nodes) can only be added by network admin | Public ownership, anyone can join and act as a node|
| Decentralized | Partially |Fully|
