### Ethereum vs Solana vs Polygon

#### Consensus

<li>It is one mandatory procedure for all the decentralized blockchain platforms.</li>
<li>It is what helps to reach an agreement on the present state of the network.</li>
<li>Ethereum follows PoW or Proof of Work mechanism of consensus.</li>
<li>Solana uses hybrid form of consensus with the best features of PoW, PoS, and PoH(Proof of History).</li>
<li>Polygon follows PoS or Proof of Stake mechanism of consensus.</li>

#### Transaction Speed

<li>The speed of transactions on a blockchain platform is one of the major factors that helps the developer decide the platform they need to work on.</li>
<li>Ethereum has very low transaction speed which can range between 15-25 transactions per second.</li>
<li>Solana has a transaction speed of around 50,000 to 65,000 transactions per second.</li>
<li>Polygon has the highest transaction speed of 65,000 transactions a second.</li>

#### Architecture

<li>Ethereum has a stateful architectures ,i.e. the platform records all the transactions in the existing state and copies of the latest transactions are immediately coined to mirror the recent transactions. It is an effective network but is slower when compared to stateless networks.</li>
<li>Solana is a stateless architecture i.e. the whole state of Solana architecture does not need to update every time. This is why Solana is very efficient and provides faster transactions.</li>
<li>Polygon is a “sidechain” scaling solution that consists of a series of blockchains running alongside the main Ethereum blockchain.</li>
