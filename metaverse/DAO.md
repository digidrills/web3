# Decentralized Autonomous Organization
<li> The Organization was inspired by the concept - Decentralization of Digital currencies
<li> Since decentralization enables to attain levels of privacy and security
<li> Member-owned communities without centralized leadership.
<li> A safe way to collaborate with internet strangers.
<li> A safe place to commit funds to a specific cause.

## Why DAO ?
<li> The developers of the DAO believed they could eliminate human error or manipulation of investor funds.
<li> Since they placed the decision-making power into the hands of an automated system and a crowdsourced process.
<li> Starting an organization with someone that involves funding and money requires a lot of trust in the people you're working with. 
<li> With DAOs you don’t need to trust anyone else in the group, just the DAO’s code(Smart Contract), which is 100% transparent and open source. <br><br>

## Comparison Study
| DAO    | Traditional Organization   |
| :---:              |    :----:   |  
| Usually flat, and fully democratized.	| Usually hierarchical | 
| Voting required by members for any changes to be implemented | 	Depending on structure, changes can be demanded from a sole party, or voting may be offered.| 
| Votes tallied, and outcome implemented automatically without trusted intermediary	| If voting allowed, votes are tallied internally, and outcome of voting must be handled manually| 
| Services offered are handled automatically in a decentralized manner (for example distribution of philanthropic funds) | 	Requires human handling, or centrally controlled automation, prone to manipulation | 
| Architecture	| Stateful architecture| 	Stateless architecture| 	Multichain architecture| 
| All activity is transparent and fully public	| Activity is typically private, and limited to the public|

## DAO Examples :
<li> A charity – you can accept membership and donations from anyone in the world and the group can decide how they want to spend donations.
<li> A freelancer network – you could create a network of contractors who pool their funds for office spaces and software subscriptions.<br><br>

## DAO Membership :
 ### Token-based membership
 <li> Usually fully permissionless, depending on the token used.
 <li> Others must be earned through providing liquidity or some other ‘proof-of-work’.
 <li> Simply holding the token grants access to voting.
 <li> Eg - MakerDAO's token MKR is widely available on decentralized exchanges.
 
 ### Share-based membership
 <li> Share-based DAOs are more permissioned.
 <li> Any members can submit a proposal to join the DAO, by offering a value in the form of tokens.
 <li> Shares represent direct voting power and ownership.
 <li> Members can exit at any time with their proportionate share of the treasury
 <li> Eg - MolochDAO is focused on funding Ethereum projects.
 
 ### Reputation-based membership
 <li> Reputation represents proof of participation and grants voting power in the DAO.
 <li> Unlike token or share-based membership, reputation-based DAOs don't transfer ownership to contributors.
 <li> DAO members must earn reputation through participation.
 <li> Reputation cannot be bought, transferred or delegated.
 <li> Members can freely submit proposals to join the DAO and request to receive reputation and tokens as a reward in exchange for their contributions.
 <li> Eg - DXdao is a global sovereign collective building. It leverages reputation-based governance.<br><br>
 
## How do DAOs work?
 
## Benefits :
<li> Opens up so many new opportunities for global collaboration and coordination.


## The DAO :
<li> The DAO was an organization created by developers to automate decisions and facilitate cryptocurrency transactions.
<li> DAO was a form of venture capital fund, based on open-source code and without a typical management structure or board of directors. 
<li> To be fully decentralized, the DAO was unaffiliated with any particular nation-state. 
<li> It makes use of the Ethereum network.
<li> Due to programming errors and attack vectors, hackers attacked the DAO, accessing 3.6 million ETH.
<li> Digital exchange currencies de-listed the DAO token in September 2016.
