# ERC-1155

## About ERC-1155
<ul>
    <li>An ERC standard for contracts that manage multiple token types
    <li>A single contract may include any combination of fungible as well as non-fungible tokens
    <li>This is possible since each function in this type of contract contains _id argument which indicates the specific token type to be used in the transaction
</ul>

## Why was ERC-1155 introduced?
<ul>
    <li>For ERC-20 and ERC-721, a seperate contract must be deployed for each token type(in case of ERC-20) or collection(in case of ERC-721)
    <li>So if a dApp needs multiple tokens for its application, separate contract needs to deployed in the blockchain
    <li>This places on a lot of redundant byte code onto the blockchain and the interation between the interaction between these contracts becomes complex
    <li>Hence why ERC-1155 was introduced
</ul>

## Transferred token in wallet using ERC-1155 standard Contract
