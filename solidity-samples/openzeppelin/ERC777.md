# ERC-777

## About ERC-777
<ul>
    <li>An ERC standard for fungible token like ERC-20
    <li>It is basically an extension to the ERC-20 standards with added functionality
    <li>One of its best feature is recieve hooks 
    <li>A hook is a function in the smart contract that is called when tokens are sent to it 
    <li> It also introduces another concept of operators
    <li> Operators are special accounts(usually another smart contract) that send tokens on behalf of another address (a holder)
    <li> Operators can be related to collecting monthly subscription fee 
</ul>

## Why was ERC-777 introduced?
<ul>
    <li>In case of ERC-20, if we send tokens to smart contracts which do not accept tokens then those tokens will be locked forever.
    <li>To overcome this issue, ERC-777 standard was introduced
    <li>Since the smart contracts are required to implement these hooks, no tokens can get stuck in a smart contract. Instead it warns the user that the contract doesn't accept that particular token.
    <li>defaultOperators() function can be used to set the permitted operators on the smart contract
    <li>The holders can authorize or revoke operators based on their needs
</ul>
